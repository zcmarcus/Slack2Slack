# Team Project: Slack2Slack
## Team Members: Kelly Palese, Sarah Schmitt, Zeph Marcus

* This repository serves as the central hub for development of 'Slack2Slack,' a team project produced for Enterprise Java (MATC - Spring Term, 2020)


### Problem Statement:
Many Slack users create Slack workspaces that are very similar, if not identical. For example, an instructor may have a separate Slack workspace for each semester or each section of a particular course. Some setup of these workspaces will be identical. They might have the same channels (name, topic, and description), workspace icons, settings/rules (for example, which channels everyone gets when they join the workplace), and the same creator's profile. However, each time the creator of these workspaces needs to create a new one, there is not a user-friendly way to quickly duplicate the workspace. Instead, they must go through the time-consuming steps of starting with a blank workspace and adding all of the setup from the very beginning.

Creators of Slack workspaces would be able to save a significant amount of time if they had the option to create a new channel using data they have already entered. This could be by "copying" select data from an existing Slack channel, or by using a template to create the new channel. This project will explore which option best meets users' needs while also complying with the data available on the Slack API. The project will then implement a solution to allow Slack workspace creators to quickly and easily create new workspaces. 

### Will offer users the following abilities:
